		<p2> <i>What an incredible journey it has been, beautiful 8-9 years! Thank you for making us a part of your precious lives and in the process of learning, you all taught us so much more than we expected from you all. This is a teeny-tiny package of all the memories shared and celebrated together. We hope you all like it and let it be a reminder of how you all taught us. :)</i></p2>
