   <p>
     Hello visitor!<br>
     I am Md Shabaaz Uddin from Hyderabad. I am 14 years old, I am currently studying in 10th grade at The Golden Jubilee English High School.
      My hobbies are watching movies, playing cricket, solving maths, learning programming, etc...<br><br>
      My journey of Programming started in pandemic, obviously cause we all were in our house no study, no playing, so I started learning things and from my childhood I have the willingness to learn computers and computer related things like programming.<br><br>So when I started everything was going above my head and slowly slowly when I started practicing it I got most of the things and my teachers helped me out getting a better course and enrolled me in cohort. There I got to know how to make website and my coding teacher and my school teachers helped me out in learning coding. <br><br>
      I am very much thankful to my school and coding teachers.They helped me out in learning and practicing.
